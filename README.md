# 3d-Printer
This is just a collection of some 3D-Prints I've done.  I'll add more over time.  
Some 3-D Prints will reside with the project they were designed for.

##PCB Etching Tank
Didn't really work, plus its kind of small.  I water tested it and it leaked.  I think it had more to to with the binding of the ABS material, than it did with the design.  Plus its small.

##Fidgets
I used a tutorial from youtube on how to make these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1-gD06OPo0.  My nephew Jake wanted me to make him one, so I did. 

* fidget/fidget.scad  This is the openscad file from that tutorial that I coded.  Nothing fancy.  It's custom to the bearings I have which are 17mm x 5mm.
* fidget/fidgetx#  I processed 2, 3, 4 & 5 endpoints and exported them to STL.

I picked the bearings up 10 x 10pc for $4 on eBay.  Yo cannot beat that $0.04 x 6 + <$1 for the ABS, thats cheap considering stores are selling them for $5.

Maybe one day I'll create something orginal.
